# Hurricane Preparedness Checklist for Asthma Patients in Florida

Living in Florida means being prepared for hurricanes. For asthma patients, extra planning is essential to ensure access to medications and maintain good air quality during and after the storm. This guide outlines steps to take before, during, and after a hurricane.

## Before the Hurricane

### 1. Essential Medications to Have
- **At least a 7‑day supply** of all asthma medications (controller inhalers, rescue inhalers, oral steroids if prescribed).
- **Extra spacers or nebulizer equipment** if you use them.
- **A printed list** of your medications, dosages, and prescribing doctor’s contact information.
- **A copy of your Asthma Action Plan** (keep it in your emergency kit).

### 2. Creating an Asthma Go‑Kit
Pack the following items in a waterproof bag or container:
- All asthma medications (inhalers, pills, nebulizer vials)
- Spacers, masks, and tubing
- Portable nebulizer (if you rely on one) with extra batteries or a car adapter
- Peak flow meter
- Written Asthma Action Plan
- Insurance cards and pharmacy information
- Emergency contact numbers (doctor, local hospital, pharmacy)

### 3. Protecting Inhalers from Water Damage
- Store inhalers in a sealed plastic bag or waterproof case.
- If evacuating, keep medications in a cooler (without ice) to prevent extreme heat exposure.
- **Do not refrigerate** inhalers unless specifically instructed by the manufacturer.

### 4. Prepare Your Home Environment
- **Check air filters** in your HVAC system and replace if dirty.
- **Ensure windows and doors** are properly sealed to reduce outdoor allergen infiltration.
- **Consider purchasing a portable air purifier** with a HEPA filter for use during power outages.

## During the Hurricane

- **Stay indoors** in a windowless interior room if possible.
- **Keep your Asthma Go‑Kit** with you at all times.
- **Use your rescue inhaler** as directed by your Asthma Action Plan if symptoms worsen.
- **Avoid using generators indoors**—carbon monoxide poisoning is a serious risk.

## After the Storm

### 1. Dealing with Poor Indoor Air Quality Post‑Storm
- **Mold growth** is common after flooding. If your home has water damage, wear an N95 mask while cleaning and consider staying elsewhere until the area is dry and mold‑free.
- **Use air conditioning or dehumidifiers** to lower indoor humidity (ideally below 50%).
- **Open windows** only when outdoor air quality is good (check local air quality reports).
- **Replace HVAC filters** that may have collected dust and mold spores.

### 2. Medication and Supply Check
- Inspect medications for water damage; if an inhaler got wet, contact your pharmacist or doctor for a replacement.
- Restock any used medications as soon as pharmacies reopen.

### 3. When to Seek Medical Help
- If your symptoms are in the **red zone** of your Asthma Action Plan.
- If you are using your rescue inhaler more than every 4 hours.
- If you experience shortness of breath, chest tightness, or wheezing that does not improve with medication.
